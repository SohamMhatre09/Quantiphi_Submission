# Troubleshooting Guide for DataVault GCP Pipeline

This document provides guidance on monitoring and troubleshooting the DataVault GCP pipeline. It covers common issues that may arise during the operation of the pipeline and offers solutions to resolve them.

## Common Issues and Solutions

### 1. Dataflow Job Failures
- **Issue**: Dataflow jobs may fail due to various reasons such as data format issues, resource constraints, or code errors.
- **Solution**: 
  - Check the Dataflow job logs in the Google Cloud Console for error messages.
  - Ensure that the input data format matches the expected schema.
  - Review the code in `src/dataflow/main.py` and the transformation functions in `src/dataflow/transforms/` for any logical errors.

### 2. High Latency in Pub/Sub Message Processing
- **Issue**: Messages may take longer than expected to be processed by the Dataflow pipeline.
- **Solution**: 
  - Monitor the Pub/Sub metrics in the Google Cloud Console to check for message backlog.
  - Ensure that the Dataflow pipeline is properly scaled to handle the incoming message load.
  - Review the Cloud Function logs in `src/cloud_functions/trigger_pipeline.py` to ensure that messages are being triggered correctly.

### 3. BigQuery Query Quota Exceeded
- **Issue**: Exceeding the allocated query quota can lead to failed queries in BigQuery.
- **Solution**: 
  - Check the BigQuery usage in the Google Cloud Console to monitor your query quota.
  - Optimize your queries in `src/sql/data_transformations.sql` to reduce resource consumption.
  - Consider increasing your quota by requesting a quota increase through the Google Cloud Console.

### 4. IAM Permission Issues
- **Issue**: Users or service accounts may encounter permission errors when accessing GCP resources.
- **Solution**: 
  - Review the IAM roles and permissions defined in `config/iam/service_account_roles.json`.
  - Ensure that the necessary roles are assigned to the appropriate users or service accounts.
  - Check the bucket policies in `config/iam/bucket_policies.json` to ensure proper access to Cloud Storage buckets.

### 5. Monitoring and Alerts
- **Issue**: Alerts may not be triggering as expected.
- **Solution**: 
  - Verify the alert configurations in `config/monitoring/alerts.json`.
  - Ensure that the monitoring services are enabled and properly configured in the Google Cloud Console.
  - Check the logs in Cloud Logging to see if the conditions for alerts are being met.
